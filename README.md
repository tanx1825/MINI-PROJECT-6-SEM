# MINI-PROJECT-6-SEM

The User places his hand in front of the camera and gestures using his hand. Our task is to identify the hand gesture and predict it in real-time and classify it in one of the gesture categories. We have classified the data in ten broad categories of hand gestures: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Nothing. 
I have used CNN to solve the above problem.Then I made and trained various Convolutional Neural Networks and checked them for their Accuracy other attributes. In doing so, I found the model that would give me the best result.
