# MINI-PROJECT-6-SEM

I have used CNN to solve the above problem. The language that I have used is Python. First, I had to create the required dataset. After doing so, I cleaned the dataset. Then I made and trained various Convolutional Neural Networks and checked them for their Accuracy other attributes. In doing so, I found the model that would give me the best result.
